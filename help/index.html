                <p>This is the help page.</p>
                <h3>1. How to play?</h3>
                <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>The game is played on a 6x7 board, with 48 pieces divided into two different colors (red-black, red-yellow, and red-blue are popular).</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Each player takes turns filling up the board with their pieces falling vertically. You can only place a piece in a column that isn't filled.</p>

        <h2>Winning</h2>
        <p>The game is won by the player that gets 4 pieces (discs/stones) in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>

        <h2>Draw</h2>
        <p>If the board is filled and there is no winner, the game will be a draw.</p>

        <h2>Time</h2>
        <p>Original 4 In A Row doesn't have any time limits, but on <a href="http://4InARow.ai">4InARow.ai</a>, we have added time as a feature. There's starting time and bonus time. Starting time is the time the clock starts with, and bonus time is the time a player gets after finishing a move. Time is by default set to 1m, with 5s bonus.</p>

        <h2>Rating</h2>
        <p>The website uses a ranking system known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system">Glicko-2</a> to calculate the rating points for each player. This rating is used to determine the right player to play against in matches. You will play against someone with a similar rating as yourself, same as in chess</p>
